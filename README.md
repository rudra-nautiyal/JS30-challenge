# JS30-challenge
<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>The challenges encountered during today's exercises were relatively straightforward. I needed to review the typeof operator and its application, which was quite informative. Additionally, I faced some difficulty understanding how to properly identify the datatype of an array, as arrays are displayed as objects unless using the <b><i>Array.isArray()</i></b> method.

The Feature request involved randomly declaring a variable with a random datatype. This was initially confusing but after some research and using <b><i>Math.random()</i></b>, I found the solution to be simpler than anticipated. Overall, it was a productive day.</p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>Today, I worked with various JavaScript operators. I performed arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder. I used assignment operators to update values, compared numbers using == and ===, and evaluated conditions with logical operators. Lastly, I created a function using the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative. These tasks reinforced my understanding of JavaScript operators.</p>
