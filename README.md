# JS30-challenge
<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>The challenges encountered during today's exercises were relatively straightforward. I needed to review the typeof operator and its application, which was quite informative. Additionally, I faced some difficulty understanding how to properly identify the datatype of an array, as arrays are displayed as objects unless using the <b><i>Array.isArray()</i></b> method.

The Feature request involved randomly declaring a variable with a random datatype. This was initially confusing but after some research and using <b><i>Math.random()</i></b>, I found the solution to be simpler than anticipated. Overall, it was a productive day.</p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>Today, I worked with various JavaScript operators. I performed arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder. I used assignment operators to update values, compared numbers using == and ===, and evaluated conditions with logical operators. Lastly, I created a function using the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative. These tasks reinforced my understanding of JavaScript operators.</p>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>Today, I worked on implementing control structures using Node.js and the <b>readline</b> module for interactive input in the terminal. I explored various control structures including conditional statements (if-else) and the switch statement to handle different types of user inputs. I practiced determining whether a number is positive, negative, or zero, checked voting eligibility based on age, and compared three numbers to find the largest. Additionally, I used the switch statement to identify days of the week and implemented grading logic based on marks. I also learned to handle leap year calculations correctly by addressing common pitfalls in conditional logic. This exercise improved my understanding of control structures and interactive programming in Node.js.</p>
