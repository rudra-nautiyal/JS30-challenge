# JS30-challenge
<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>The challenges encountered during today's exercises were relatively straightforward. I needed to review the typeof operator and its application, which was quite informative. Additionally, I faced some difficulty understanding how to properly identify the datatype of an array, as arrays are displayed as objects unless using the <b><i>Array.isArray()</i></b> method.

The Feature request involved randomly declaring a variable with a random datatype. This was initially confusing but after some research and using <b><i>Math.random()</i></b>, I found the solution to be simpler than anticipated. Overall, it was a productive day.</p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>Today, I worked with various JavaScript operators. I performed arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder. I used assignment operators to update values, compared numbers using == and ===, and evaluated conditions with logical operators. Lastly, I created a function using the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative. These tasks reinforced my understanding of JavaScript operators.</p>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>Today, I worked on implementing control structures using Node.js and the <b>readline</b> module for interactive input in the terminal. I explored various control structures including conditional statements (if-else) and the switch statement to handle different types of user inputs. I practiced determining whether a number is positive, negative, or zero, checked voting eligibility based on age, and compared three numbers to find the largest. Additionally, I used the switch statement to identify days of the week and implemented grading logic based on marks. I also learned to handle leap year calculations correctly by addressing common pitfalls in conditional logic. This exercise improved my understanding of control structures and interactive programming in Node.js.</p>

<h1>Day 4</h1>
<p>Today, I delved into JavaScript loops and it was both insightful and rewarding. I practiced for loops to print sequences and create multiplication tables, which clarified loop basics and variable usage. Using while loops for summing numbers and reversing sequences improved my understanding of loop conditions and accumulation.

The do...while loop showed me how to ensure at least one iteration, and building a factorial calculator with user input was a challenging but fulfilling exercise in input validation. Creating star patterns was a fun way to see string methods in action with loops.

Overall, I feel accomplished and more confident in handling loops and control flow in JavaScript.</p>

<h1>Day 5</h1>
<p>Today, I explored various JavaScript functions, which was a mix of familiar concepts and new challenges. I really enjoyed learning about arrow functions and higher-order functions, as they were new to me and added a fresh layer of understanding. Implementing simple tasks like checking if a number is even or odd, calculating squares and cubes, comparing numbers, and concatenating strings was straightforward and enjoyable.

The most challenging part was the higher-order functions, especially when I had to input and use two functions together. It was a bit confusing at first, but I felt really good when I finally got it right. Overall, the day felt easier because of my prior experience with functions, making it a satisfying and rewarding learning experience.</p>

<h1>Day 6</h1>
<p>Today, I worked with arrays in JavaScript, exploring a variety of operations such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code>. I practiced manipulating arrays by adding and removing elements, iterating over arrays, and formatting data.

Tasks like pushing, popping, shifting, and unshifting elements in an array were straightforward and felt familiar. Implementing <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code> functions was enjoyable, and I appreciated the opportunity to work with higher-order functions.

The most challenging part was combining functions and understanding their interaction, but it was satisfying to see it all come together. Overall, the day felt easy because I already had quite a lot of experience with arrays, and I only needed to Google a few things. It was a rewarding learning experience.</p>

<h1>Day 7</h1>
<p>Today, I delved into objects in JavaScript, focusing on creating and manipulating them. I worked with defining object properties and methods, and explored object-oriented practices with both individual objects and arrays of objects.

I practiced tasks like logging object details, updating object properties, and iterating over object keys. I also learned to use <code>this</code> within object methods to refer to the current object.

This was quite a challenging day as I hadn't used objects extensively in major projects before, so I had forgotten a lot of the concepts. However, this exercise jogged my memory and helped me understand objects better. Tasks after Task 2 were quite new to me, but referring to MDN docs and Googling with ChatGPT proved to be very helpful in getting through the challenges.</p>
